# Introduction

When it comes to performing advanced text and filtering queries, by default, every Webiny CMS project relies on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

In this examples section, we show how you can interact with it, using the automatically included [ElasticSearch client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html).

# Available Examples

- [Performing Custom Searches on Pages](pages-custom-search) - shows how to create a custom `customSearchPages` GraphQL query which performs a custom query against an ElasticSearch index

# Want to inspect your own ElasticSearch cluster and the data in it?

To explore your up and running ElasticSearch cluster, we recommend the [aws-es-kibana](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-es-kibana) library.
