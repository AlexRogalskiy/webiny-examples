This folder contains full code samples for the [Securing Your Application](https://www.webiny.com/docs/tutorials/create-an-application/security/introduction/) tutorial.

Note that the code is a bit rudimentary - meaning it could be refactored a bit. For example, throughout the whole code, we're essentially copying logic that should probably be abstracted withing a simple utility function, or, in case of React code, a simple React hook.    

If you'd like to see a refactored version here as well, please give us a ping on our community [Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack).
