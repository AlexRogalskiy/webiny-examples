# What is this?

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

It shows a way to render forms built using [Webiny Form Builder](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/webiny-apps/form-builder/introduction) from your own React app.

Setup
Clone the repo, then run yarn to install dependencies. Once all the deps are installed, go to `src/App.js` and update the `WEBINY_API_URL` constant with the URL of your API. Finally, run `yarn start` to see it in action.
