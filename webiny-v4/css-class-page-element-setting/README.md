# Creating Custom Page Element Settings (CSS class)

Weâ€™ll create a new element setting that will allow content creators to add CSS class to any page element.

Steps to reproduce the project:

1. Make sure to follow up the [Prerequisites section](https://docs.webiny.com/docs/guides/creating-custom-element-settings-plugin) in the guide.
2. Move to `apps/admin` folder and add the plugin files in `src`.
3. Open the `src/App.tsx` file and import the plugin that we just created then register in by adding to plugins array inside the default export.
